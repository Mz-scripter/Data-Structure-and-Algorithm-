Solving DSA problems from leetcode
## Day 1
### [Find the Closest Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-number-to-zero/description/)
You're to find the closest number to zero in a given array or a python list

## Day 2
### [Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/)
You're given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge these strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

## Day 3
### [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)
Covert a string of roman numerals to an integer.

## Day 4
### [Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/)
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `s` is a *subsequence* of `t`, or `false` otherwise.
A *subsequence* of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

## Day 5
### [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Day 6
### [Summary Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/) LeetCode 228
This problem was quite challenging, but I was able to solve it fairly easily. Even though the solution has two `while` loops, it surprisingly has a time complexity of `O(n)`.

## Day 7
### [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)
Took a crack at Leetcode 238 (Product of Array Except Self) for the first time. Coming up with a solution was a breezeâ€”probably because I totally ignored the constraints. ðŸ˜… Both of my solutions are O(n^2), which isn't exactly ideal, but hey, they work!
I found this code online that seemed like a good explanation, but Iâ€™m still not sure I fully understand it.
Here are my first solutions, though they don't follow the constraints yet

## Day 8
### [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)
I tried Leetcode 56 (Merge Intervals), and my solution was accepted with a time complexity of O(NlogN). It ran in 140ms but only beat 5.53% of submissions, which was surprising. The code is pretty straightforward since I'm still learning ðŸ˜…. Took a look at the top solutions and found some interesting approaches.
